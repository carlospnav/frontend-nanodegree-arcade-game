#Frontend-Nanodegree-Arcade-Game
===============================
##Description
This is a student project done for Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree. It is a version of the classic Atari game Frogger, developed to better understand what Javascript offers in Object-Oriented programming. My contribution to this project were developing the entities of the game along with all their functionalities, the collision system and the Victory/Defeat conditions.

##Instructions
In order to play this game, the browser needs to support **canvas** functionality. Most modern browsers will support it, except IE which requires version 11. This version of Frogger runs with the arrow keys to move the player. The goal is to have the player reach the other side of the road without being caught by the bugs.
